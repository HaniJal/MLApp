Practical ML Pipeline (Regression + Classification CLI App)

This project is a command-line Machine Learning application written in Python.
The program behaves like a small ML product: it can train models, evaluate them, save them, and later load them to make predictions based on user input.

The application supports two tasks:

Regression – predicts a continuous numeric value (house price).
Classification – predicts whether a website is phishing or legitimate.

The program saves trained models using pickle so users can reuse trained models without retraining.
